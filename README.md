# js-dev-env-starter

This is a js dev environment starter pack. We are using following things:
1. Webpack v1 - as a bundler, webserver
2. babel - to transpile our code from ES6 to ES5
3. ES6 module system - its standardized, fails fast, named imports, default exports
4. Sourcemaps for easy debugging
5. ESLint - to lint our JS code
6. Automated Unit testing setup - We are using *Mocha* as a testing framework with *Chai* as an assertion Library
7. Best practice to write test cases
8. Travis - for Continous Integration, It is a Linux based hosted solution
9. Mock HTTP - to simulate backend API calls
10. Dynamic HTML generation - HTML-webpack-plugin
11. Bundle Splitting - Useful for larger apps
12. [TrackJS] https://trackjs.com/ - Nice Error Logging tool so that you can get to know when your users run into errors and fix bugs before they report them.

Will update the documentation along with the latest versions of the tools and plugins I am using in this starter pack
